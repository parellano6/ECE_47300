However, neural networks can do much more than this. Autoencoders is one of the easist implementation that allows the neural network to output image-like data.  \n","\n","Autoencoders are a general class of neural networks that consist of two components: an encoder and a decoder.\n","The encoder takes the image and encodes it into a low dimensional vector representation. \n","The decoder takes the vector and decompresses it into something close to the original image.\n","Autoencoders have a variety of useful applications including denoising of images.\n","Moreover, they are just cool because they provide a mechanism to represent complex image content as low dimensional vectors.\n","\n","Another important feature of autoencoders is that they use unsupervised training. \n","In other words, they can be trained without training labels.\n","This is important because in many cases it may be difficult to obtain labeled training data or ground truth. \n","\n","In this section, we will learn how to implement a simple autoencoder using a fully connected neural network. \n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mm3tS9wSqPOl"},"source":["Again, we are using our old friend the MNIST data.
