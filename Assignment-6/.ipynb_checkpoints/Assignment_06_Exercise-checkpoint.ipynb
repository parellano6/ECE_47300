    "The latent (i.e., hidden) representations generated by a deep neural network are very important concept in deep learning since the latent space is where the most significant features of the dataset are learned and extracted.\n",

You can read more about batch normalization and skip connections in these papers https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf, respectively.\n",
    "*  In this neural network, the block networks are designed so that the input dimension and the output dimension stay the same. This may not be an optimal design, but it will help us visualize the latent representation later."
